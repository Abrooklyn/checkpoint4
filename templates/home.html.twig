            A freak show is an exhibition of biological rarities,
            referred to in popular culture as "freaks of nature".
            Typical features would be physically unusual humans,
            such as those uncommonly large or small, those with
            both male and female secondary sexual characteristics,
            those with extraordinary diseases and conditions,
            and others with performances expected to be shocking to viewers.
            Heavily tattooed or pierced people have sometimes been seen
            in freak shows, as have attention-getting physical performers
            such as fire-eating and sword-swallowing acts.
