            In the circus world, freak shows, also called sideshows,
            were an essential part of the circus. The largest sideshow
            was attached to the most prestigious circus, Ringling Brothers,
            Barnum and Bailey, known as the “big one”. It was a symbol of
            the peak of the practice and its acceptance in American society.

            It was at this time that single human oddities started joining
            traveling circuses during the early 1800s, but these shows
            weren’t organized into anything like the sideshows we know until
            the midcentury. During the 1870s it was common to see most
            circuses having freak shows, eventually making the circus a
            major place for the display of human oddities.
